# .config-nixos

## To fix

### general

- remove nodejs

- fix my github account on the laptop???
- make nixos-config repo and use git submodule

- what goes into modules/nixos exactly?

- fix battery life, still goes down kind of quickly even with auto-cpufreq on

### autocpu-freq

- doesn't start on its own, need to nixos-rebuild to actually start it
    - check with autocpu-freq --stats
    - seems to be a problem related to this service specifically

### python

- how do i setup pokemon icat without having global packages? can i even do that?
